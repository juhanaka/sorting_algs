Sorting algorithm practice
==========================

I recently did an algorithm course at uni, and wanted to try out the algorithms and O(n log n) vs. O(n^2) in practice. Also, I hadn't done anything with C before, so I decided this was the best way to learn the basics. 

This is a super simple command line program that sorts an input file of integers with the selected sorting algorithm. The time consumed by the sorting algorithm is printed out, and the sorted array can be printed to stdout if so chosen. 

Currently implemented algorithms:
---------------------------------
Merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort
